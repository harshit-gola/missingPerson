					    <h3>Are you a young person and someone you care about is missing?</h3>
						    <p>We speak to adults and children every day who  are either away from home, or are thinking about leaving. Although many people feel this way, every person’s situation is different as are their reasons for wanting to go missing.</p>
							<p>We understand that it can be very complicated and there might not always be an easy solution. You may have had relationship problems, financial worries, suffered from domestic abuse or have psychological issues or drug or alcohol dependency which you’re struggling to cope with. There could be one major issue that made you want to go missing, or a series of problems which have mounted and left you feeling it was your only option.</p>
							<p>There could be help available that may mean you can return home or reconnect with your loved ones and we can put you in touch with organisations that can support you. But if you know you have been reported missing and want to stop the police and/or Missing People looking for you, our highly trained helpline advisors are on hand any time, day or night, to discuss your options and help you stay safe.</p>

					    	You might be reading this because you are away from home, or because you feel you need to leave home. Whatever your situation, you are not alone. We are here to help you explore your options getting you the support you need to stay safe. You may wish to return home, reconnect with family and friends or to simply let someone you care about know you’re okay. We can help you to do this.
						</p>
						<p>
							We also know that people go missing for many different reasons and that returning home or getting in touch with family may not always be an option. We respect your right to go missing, and to stay missing, if that is what you want to do. If you’re struggling to work out what to do next, we can give practical advice over the phone on how to stay safe and find the support you need.

							<h4>Do you have somewhere safe to go?</h4>
							<p>You might be thinking about returning home and reconnecting with those you left behind. There may be reasons why you might not be able to return to the home you left so you might be looking to find new accommodation.</p>

							<h4>Do you have everything you need?</h4>
							<p>If you feel leaving is your only option make sure you have everything you need to stay safe and well, such as medication and documentation, like a passport or another form of I.D.</p>
